# Input To Controller Mapper

This Windows application maps various input devices to a virtual Xbox 360 controller. The UI now supports keyboard-only navigation and a selectable light or dark theme. High DPI displays are handled via `PerMonitorV2` DPI awareness.

### Keyboard navigation
* All controls have explicit tab order so the entire interface can be used without a mouse.
* Status indicators include descriptive accessibility text for screen readers.
* Theme selection label is skipped in tab order for smoother navigation.

### Theme support
* Use the **Theme Selection** drop-down at the top of the main window to switch between light and dark themes.

### High DPI
* DPI scaling is enabled for all forms so the app remains sharp on highâ€‘resolution screens.
